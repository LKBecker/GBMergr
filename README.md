GBMergr
=======

Batch merges a folder of GenBank files into one, or inserts spacers into a multiple-entry file, for viewing in Artemis.

Place all input files into /raw/ 
The script lets you either merge all files from /raw/ into a single file, or select one file from /raw/ and convert it. If you batch-merge, make sure all files in /raw/ are supposed to be in the merge!

Output files will be put into /output/

Make sure the script is in a folder with a /raw/ and an /output/ as it should not be able to make folders by itself.
